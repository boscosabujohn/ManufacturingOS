## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Choose Your Approach

**Option A: Add aria-label** (Fastest - minimal visual change)
```tsx
// Before
<button>
  <Eye className="h-5 w-5" />
</button>

// After
<button aria-label="View">
  <Eye className="h-5 w-5" />
</button>
```

**Option B: Add visible text** (Recommended - better UX)
```tsx
// Before
<button>
  <Eye className="h-5 w-5" />
</button>

// After
<button className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-3 py-2">
  <Eye className="h-5 w-5" />
  <span>View</span>
</button>
```

### Step 2: Open the CSV File

File: `BUTTON_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.csv`

It looks like this:

| Module | File Path | Line | Icon | Suggested Text | Context |
|--------|-----------|------|------|----------------|---------|
| CRM | .../contacts/page.tsx | 469 | Eye | View | contacts page |
| CRM | .../contacts/page.tsx | 472 | Edit | Edit | contacts page |

### Step 3: Fix Your First Button

1. Go to the file path in the first row
2. Navigate to the line number
3. Find the button with that icon
4. Add the suggested text (using Option A or B above)
5. Save the file

**Time: ~30 seconds per button**

### Step 4: Test & Repeat

1. Visually check the button looks good

3. Mark that row as complete
4. Move to next row

2. **Use find/replace**: Search for icon names to locate buttons quickly
3. **Test visually**: Check layout doesn't break
4. **Commit often**: One module at a time
5. **Ask questions**: Better to ask than guess
