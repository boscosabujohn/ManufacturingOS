# ✅ Supplier Scorecard - Issue Fixed

## Problem
The **Supplier Scorecard** component had a JSX syntax error that prevented compilation.

## Error Details
```
Error: Identifier expected.
File: src/components/procurement/SupplierScorecard.tsx
Line: 297
Code: <div className="text-sm text-gray-600">Score <75</div>
```

## Root Cause
The `<` symbol in the text "Score <75" was not escaped. In JSX, `<` is a reserved character that starts JSX elements.

## Solution Applied
Changed unescaped `<` to HTML entity `&lt;`:

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="text-sm text-gray-600">Score <75</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="text-sm text-gray-600">Score &lt;75</div>
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Component now compiles successfully

## Related Fixes
This same issue was also fixed in:
- `SupplierRelationshipManagement.tsx` (Line 573)

## How to Prevent
Always escape special HTML/JSX characters in text content:
- `<` → `&lt;`
- `>` → `&gt;`
- `&` → `&amp;`
- `"` → `&quot;`
- `'` → `&#39;`

Or use JavaScript expressions:
```tsx
<div>{'Score < 75'}</div>
<div>{`Score < 75`}</div>
```
