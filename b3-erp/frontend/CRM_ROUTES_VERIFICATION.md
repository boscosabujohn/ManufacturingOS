   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Verify Route Access:**
   - Make sure you're accessing the correct URL path

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Navigation Menu
The new routes have been created but may not appear in the navigation menu yet. To add them to the navigation:

1. Locate the CRM navigation component (likely in `src/components/navigation/` or layout files)
2. Add menu items for:
   - Settings → Assignment Rules
   - Settings → Approval Workflows
   - Marketing → Email Templates
   - Marketing → Campaigns
   - Integrations → Social Media

### Module Structure
All CRM routes follow Next.js App Router conventions:
```
src/app/(modules)/crm/
├── settings/
│   ├── assignment-rules/page.tsx ✅
│   └── approval-workflows/page.tsx ✅
├── marketing/
│   ├── email-templates/page.tsx ✅
│   └── campaigns/page.tsx ✅
├── integrations/
│   └── social-media/page.tsx ✅
└── opportunities/
    └── [id]/page.tsx ✅
```
