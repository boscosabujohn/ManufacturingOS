## üìù Implementation Notes

### Design Patterns to Follow
1. **CRUD Operations**: Use consistent modal forms across all modules
2. **Delete Confirmations**: Always show impact analysis (e.g., "This will affect 5 related records")
3. **Workflow UI**: Use visual flow diagrams (Sankey/flowchart style)
4. **Import/Export**: Use wizard pattern with progress indicators
5. **AI Features**: Show confidence scores and explanations
6. **Mobile First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop

### Component Library to Use
- Use existing UI components from `src/components/ui/`
- Create new reusable components as needed
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add TypeScript types for all props

### State Management
- Use React useState/useContext for local state
- Prepare for Redux/Zustand integration later
- Keep state management consistent
