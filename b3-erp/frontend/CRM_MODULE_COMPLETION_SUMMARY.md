## 🎓 Patterns and Best Practices Established

### 1. Delete Pattern
```typescript
// Enhanced delete with impact analysis
<ConfirmDialog
  isOpen={showDeleteDialog}
  onClose={() => setShowDeleteDialog(false)}
  onConfirm={confirmDelete}
  title="Delete Item"
  message="Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
  variant="danger"
  impactAnalysis={[
    { label: 'Related Activities', count: 5 },
    { label: 'Documents', count: 3 }
  ]}
/>
```

### 2. Bulk Operations Pattern
```typescript
// Checkbox selection + bulk action bar
{selectedIds.size > 0 && (
  <BulkActionsBar
    selectedCount={selectedIds.size}
    onDelete={handleBulkDelete}
    onExport={handleBulkExport}
    onClear={() => setSelectedIds(new Set())}
  />
)}
```

### 3. Inline Editing Pattern
```typescript
// Clickable badge with dropdown
<button onClick={() => setDropdownOpen(id)}>
  <Badge>{status}</Badge>
</button>
{dropdownOpen === id && (
  <Dropdown options={allStatuses} onChange={handleChange} />
)}
```

### 4. Filter Save/Load Pattern
```typescript
// Advanced filters with persistence
<AdvancedFilters>
  {filters.map(filter => <FilterInput />)}
  <SaveFilterButton onClick={handleSave} />
  <LoadFilterDropdown filters={savedFilters} />
</AdvancedFilters>
```

### 5. Toast Notification Pattern
```typescript
// Consistent feedback
const { addToast } = useToast();
addToast({
  title: 'Success',
  message: 'Operation completed successfully',
  variant: 'success'
});
```
