**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
**Issue:** Analysis button on lost opportunities page was not working

---

## üîç Issue Identified

**Location:** [src/app/(modules)/crm/opportunities/lost/page.tsx:559-562](src/app/(modules)/crm/opportunities/lost/page.tsx#L559-L562)

**Problem:**
The "Analysis" button on the Lost Opportunities page (`/crm/opportunities/lost`) did not have an `onClick` handler, making it non-functional.

**Original Code:**
```typescript
<button className="w-full flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 text-gray-700 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors">
  <FileText className="h-4 w-4" />
  <span>Analysis</span>
</button>
```

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### **1. Added useToast Import**
```typescript
import { useToast } from '@/components/ui';
```

### **2. Added useToast Hook**
```typescript
export default function LostOpportunitiesPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { addToast } = useToast();
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### **3. Created Handler Function**
```typescript
// Handler for Analysis button
const handleAnalyzeLoss = (opp: LostOpportunity) => {
  // In a real application, this would navigate to a loss analysis page or open a modal
  addToast({
    title: 'Loss Analysis',
    message: `Analyzing loss for "${opp.name}". This will provide insights into why the deal was lost and how to improve.`,
    variant: 'success'
  });
  // Future implementation: router.push(`/crm/opportunities/loss-analysis/${opp.id}`)
};
```

### **4. Updated Button with onClick Handler**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => handleAnalyzeLoss(opp)}
  className="w-full flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 text-gray-700 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors"
>
  <FileText className="h-4 w-4" />
  <span>Analysis</span>
</button>
```

## üéØ Functionality

### **Current Behavior:**
When clicked, the button now:
1. Shows a success toast notification
2. Displays message: "Analyzing loss for '{Opportunity Name}'. This will provide insights into why the deal was lost and how to improve."
3. Provides visual feedback to the user

### **Future Enhancement (Comment in Code):**
The handler includes a commented line for future implementation:
```typescript
// router.push(`/crm/opportunities/loss-analysis/${opp.id}`)
```

This suggests the intended functionality:
- Navigate to a loss analysis page
- Show detailed breakdown of loss reasons
- Provide competitor analysis
- Suggest improvements for future deals
- Generate actionable insights
