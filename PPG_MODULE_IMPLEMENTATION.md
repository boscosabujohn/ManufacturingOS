  id: string;
  planNumber: string;
  planName: string;
  productLine: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'scheduled' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  totalCapacity: number;
  usedCapacity: number;
  capacityUnit: string;
  materialsReady: number;
  materialsRequired: number;
  workOrdersTotal: number;
  workOrdersCompleted: number;
  onSchedulePercentage: number;
  shiftPlan: string;
  planner: string;

## UI/UX Improvements

### Color Coding:
- **Blue**: View actions, scheduled items, capacity metrics
- **Green**: Edit actions, completed items, available materials, export
- **Red**: Delete actions, cancelled items, unavailable materials
- **Yellow**: In progress items, partial availability
- **Purple**: Performance metrics, progress updates
- **Gray**: Draft items, inactive elements

### Modal Design Patterns:
- Consistent gradient headers with contextual colors
- Icon-based section headers for visual hierarchy
- Responsive layouts adapting to content
- Proper spacing and padding throughout
- Accessible form controls with labels
- Clear action buttons (Cancel/Save/Export)

### Progress Indicators:
- Progress bars for capacity utilization
- Progress bars for materials readiness
- Progress bars for work order completion
- Percentage badges for at-a-glance status

### Status Badges:
- Rounded pill design
- Color-coded backgrounds
- Semibold text for readability
- Consistent sizing across the application

---

## Mock Data

### Mock Work Orders (in ViewPlanModal):
- 3 sample work orders with different statuses
- Realistic product names (Commercial Oven, Prep Table, Industrial Mixer)
- Date ranges within plan timeline
- Status progression (Completed → In Progress → Scheduled)

### Mock Materials (in ViewPlanModal):
- 3 sample materials with different availability
- Realistic item codes and names
- Varied quantities and units
- All three status types represented

---

## Integration Points

### Ready for Backend Integration:

1. **API Endpoints Needed**:
   ```
   GET    /api/production/ppg/plans           - List all plans
   POST   /api/production/ppg/plans           - Create new plan
   GET    /api/production/ppg/plans/:id       - Get plan details
   PUT    /api/production/ppg/plans/:id       - Update plan
   DELETE /api/production/ppg/plans/:id       - Delete plan
   GET    /api/production/ppg/plans/:id/work-orders - Get work orders
   GET    /api/production/ppg/plans/:id/materials   - Get materials
   GET    /api/production/ppg/plans/:id/timeline    - Get timeline events
   POST   /api/production/ppg/plans/export    - Export plans
   ```

2. **Export Implementation**:
   - Current: Alert-based confirmation
   - Backend: Generate file and trigger download
   - Formats: CSV, Excel (.xlsx), PDF
   - Filtering: Apply selected status filters

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Current: Client-side state management
   - Backend: PostgreSQL/MySQL database
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket (optional)

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Create new production plan
- [ ] Edit existing plan
- [ ] View plan details in all tabs
- [ ] Filter plans by status
- [ ] Search plans by keywords
- [ ] Paginate through plans
- [ ] Export plans in different formats
- [ ] Delete plan with confirmation
- [ ] Validate form inputs
- [ ] Check responsive layout on different screens

### Edge Cases Handled:
- Empty state when no plans exist
- Pagination with single page
- Search with no results
- Modal close on backdrop click
- Form validation errors
- Event propagation prevention on nested buttons

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Current Implementation:
- Client-side filtering (fast for small datasets)
- Pagination to limit rendered items
- Modal lazy rendering (only when open)
- Event handler optimization with stopPropagation

### Future Enhancements:
- Server-side pagination for large datasets
- Debounced search input
- Virtualized lists for work orders/materials
- Memoization of computed values
- Lazy loading of modal content

---

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation:
- Tab navigation through form fields
- Enter to submit forms
- Escape to close modals

### Screen Reader Support:
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper label associations
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Descriptive button text

### Visual Accessibility:
- High contrast colors
- Clear focus indicators
- Readable font sizes
- Color is not the only indicator

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Breakpoints Handled:
- **Mobile (< 640px)**: Single column layout, condensed cards
- **Tablet (640px - 1024px)**: Two-column metrics, adjusted modals
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Full four-column metrics, wide modals

### Modal Adaptations:
- Full-screen on mobile
- Centered with max-width on desktop
- Scrollable content areas
- Responsive form grids

---

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Features:
1. **Gantt Chart View**: Visual timeline for production plans
2. **Capacity Planning**: AI-powered capacity optimization
3. **Resource Allocation**: Drag-and-drop resource assignment
4. **Real-time Notifications**: Updates on plan status changes
5. **Collaboration**: Comments and mentions in plans
6. **Templates**: Pre-configured plan templates
7. **Analytics Dashboard**: Production efficiency metrics
8. **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
9. **Integration**: ERP, MES, and warehouse systems
10. **Predictive Analytics**: ML-based delay predictions
