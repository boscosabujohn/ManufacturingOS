## [P1-01] Scaffold monorepo and wire cross-layer import lint canary

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** _(none — root)_  
- **PRD user stories:** #5  
- **Layers touched:** repo, CI  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:platform, area:ci`  

**Ships:** Django + DRF + Next.js scaffolding, CI pipeline, and a cross-layer import linter that fails the build on layer violations — proven by a canary test that *expects* failure.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Django 4.2 backend project and Next.js 14 frontend project committed with agreed folder layout reflecting the 5 layers (platform / core / modes / compliance / packs).
- CI pipeline runs lint, typecheck, and tests on every PR.
- Cross-layer import linter rejects: core → pack imports, pack → pack imports, upward imports from platform.
- A deliberately-violating canary test exists and is expected-to-fail; if it ever passes, the build fails with a clear message.
- README documents the layer model and the 'add an extension point, don't patch core' rule.

## [P5-11] Resolve PRD open questions: Q4 (Generic SKU), Q7 (pack licensing), integration priority, named platform owner, ACERO suite ownership

- **Phase:** 5  
- **Type:** HITL — _Entirely human decisions; not a code ticket but gates go-live communication._  
- **Blocked by:** _(none — root)_  
- **Layers touched:** docs  
- **Labels:** `phase:5, type:hitl, area:docs, phase-gate, risk:prd-opens`  

**Ships:** Written resolutions (or explicit deferrals) for each remaining PRD open question, captured in the runbook and release notes.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Q4 resolution documented or explicitly deferred with owner and next-review date.
- Q7 resolution documented or explicitly deferred with owner and next-review date.
- Third-party integration v1 scope decided; impacts P2-06 connector priority retroactively.
- Named platform owner documented in runbook and on-call rotation.
- ACERO regression suite ownership assigned.

---

## [P1-02] Tenancy foundation: tenant_id + PostgreSQL RLS + tenant-scoped repository

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-01  
- **PRD user stories:** #4  
- **Layers touched:** schema, service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:platform, area:security`  

**Ships:** Non-nullable tenant_id on every non-reference table, PostgreSQL row-level-security policies enforced, and an ORM-layer repository that rejects any query missing tenant context.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Base model enforces non-nullable tenant_id on all tenant-scoped tables; reference tables explicitly opted out.
- RLS policies enabled on all tenant-scoped tables; raw SQL without tenant context is rejected by the database.
- Tenant-scoped repository pattern raises a clear exception if called without an active tenant context.
- Cross-tenant isolation test proves tenant A cannot read tenant B entity by id (returns not-found, not access-denied).
- Tenant provisioning API creates a tenant and returns its id; provisioned tenant rows are visible only under that tenant's context.

---

## [P1-05] Pack registry: manifest parser, schema, and loader

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-01  
- **PRD user stories:** #1  
- **Layers touched:** schema, service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:platform, area:extension-framework`  

**Ships:** Packs are declarative YAML manifests validated against a JSON schema and registered in a pack_registry table. Bootstraps with zero packs; a fixture manifest proves validation.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Pack manifest JSON schema published; includes id, name, version, depends_on (modes, compliance, core_version_range), and extends (entities, workflows, screens, seeds, reports, integrations).
- pack_registry table stores manifest + activation status per tenant.
- Manifest parser rejects invalid manifests with field-level errors.
- Fixture test manifest loads successfully; a deliberately-broken manifest fails validation with the exact offending field.
- core_version_range mismatch fails fast with a clear error before any pack code runs.

---

## [P1-07] Event bus: RabbitMQ publish-subscribe with at-least-once delivery for CustomerRequirementCreated

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-01  
- **PRD user stories:** #3  
- **Layers touched:** service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:platform, area:events`  

**Ships:** A single event type (CustomerRequirementCreated) can be published by core and consumed by multiple pack subscribers, at-least-once. No DLQ or replay yet (those arrive in Phase 2).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Producer API: publish(event_type, payload, tenant_id); payload is validated against a registered event schema.
- Subscriber API: packs register handlers by event_type at pack-load time.
- Delivery is at-least-once: a subscriber that acks is not redelivered; a subscriber that fails is retried per policy.
- Two subscribers to the same event both receive it independently; failure of one does not block the other.
- Test covers: publish succeeds, both subscribers consume, subscriber failure is retried.

---

## [P2-11] Localisation: i18n extraction pipeline, l10n formatters, RTL layout support, country validator hook

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-01  
- **Layers touched:** service, UI, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:localisation`  

**Ships:** Localisation infrastructure ready: every UI label is extractable; l10n formatters for date/number/currency are in place; RTL CSS infrastructure ready. No second locale shipped yet; validation in Phase 5.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- i18n extraction run produces a labels catalogue covering every UI screen currently shipping.
- Frontend renders RTL correctly when locale direction is RTL (validated on a synthetic fixture).
- Number, date, currency formatters produce locale-appropriate output for at least en-US, en-GB, ar-AE fixtures.
- Country validator extension hook ready: future localisation packs register GST/VAT/ZATCA/etc. validators.

---

## [P1-03] Identity: OIDC login with one role and tenant membership enforcement

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** HITL — _OIDC provider selection (Keycloak / Auth0 / Azure AD / self-hosted) is an architecture decision affecting ops cost and enterprise-sales posture._  
- **Blocked by:** P1-01, P1-02  
- **PRD user stories:** #4  
- **Layers touched:** service, API, UI, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:hitl, area:platform, area:identity`  

**Ships:** An authenticated user can log in via OIDC, is assigned the single 'user' role for Phase 1, and their session is scoped to one tenant. No MFA, no SAML, no ABAC yet.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- OIDC provider choice documented in ADR; provider is configured in dev and staging.
- Successful OIDC login produces a session bound to (user_id, tenant_id); missing tenant membership rejects login.
- Session middleware populates tenant context consumed by the Phase 1-02 repository.
- Logout terminates the session and invalidates the backend token.
- Integration test: unauthenticated request to any API returns 401; cross-tenant session cannot read other tenant data.

---

## [P1-04] Audit: hash-chained mutation log with tamper-detection job

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-02  
- **PRD user stories:** #2, #17  
- **Layers touched:** schema, service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:platform, area:audit`  

**Ships:** Every mutation on every tenant-scoped entity writes an audit record with previous_hash + this_hash; a scheduled verification job detects any tampering in the chain.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- audit_record schema includes: actor, timestamp (tz-aware), tenant_id, entity_type, entity_id, operation, before_state (jsonb), after_state (jsonb), reason_for_change, previous_hash, this_hash, layer.
- ORM-level signal writes audit records on every create/update/delete within the same DB transaction as the mutation.
- Hash chain is per-entity (each entity has its own chain); tamper-detection job runs on schedule and raises an alert on first break.
- Audit query API: given entity type + id, return full chronological history in under 1 second for entities with up to 10,000 records.
- Test: mutate an audit row directly in DB; verification job reports the break on its next run.

---

## [P1-06] Extension Framework: integration connector extension point for source_type parsers

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-05  
- **PRD user stories:** #1, #9, #14  
- **Layers touched:** service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:platform, area:extension-framework`  

**Ships:** The one extension point required by the tracer bullet: packs register parsers against CustomerRequirement.source_type values. Other nine extension points ship in Phase 2.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Extension-point registry accepts pack-supplied parser callables keyed by source_type.
- Core calls the registered parser by source_type; if none is registered, returns a clear 'no parser registered' error (not a 500).
- Registering two parsers for the same source_type is rejected at pack-load time.
- Test: two fake packs register for different source_types; both invoke independently; neither leaks into the other.

---

## [P2-07] Workflow Engine: JSON state machines, named insertion points, pack-registered step handlers, definition versioning

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-05  
- **PRD user stories:** #10, #15  
- **Layers touched:** schema, service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:workflow`  

**Ships:** Workflow Engine as a real platform service: state machines are JSON data (not code), packs insert steps at named insertion points, running instances complete on the definition version they started on.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Workflow definitions are JSON conforming to a published schema; core ships the QuotationApproval definition with declared insertion points (e.g., 'after_initial_review').
- Packs register step-type handlers; runtime resolves handler by pack + step-type name.
- workflow_instance records the definition version; a mid-flight definition change does not mutate running instances.
- Failure of a pack-inserted step is attributed to the pack in logs, metrics, and error envelope.
- Test: activate KitchenEquipment pack (which inserts finishing_review_step); verify it appears in new instances and not in already-running instances.

---

## [P5-04] Pack-version compatibility matrix published; fail-fast on mismatch verified

- **Phase:** 5  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-05  
- **Layers touched:** docs, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:5, type:afk, area:docs, area:release-mgmt`  

**Ships:** Compatibility matrix of pack versions × core versions published; fail-fast rejection of mismatched versions verified end-to-end.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Matrix lives in /docs/compatibility-matrix.md and is updated per release.
- Pack activation rejects pack v1.2 against core v2.1 if out of declared range, with a clear error.
- Semver discipline documented for both pack and core release processes.

---

## [P2-04] Event bus hardening: DLQ, subscriber-initiated replay, per-subscriber observability

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-07  
- **PRD user stories:** #3  
- **Layers touched:** service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:events`  

**Ships:** The event bus from Phase 1 gets DLQ handling, replay from timestamp, and per-subscriber visibility.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Subscriber retry policy: exponential backoff with configured ceiling; after budget exhausted, event routes to DLQ with alert.
- Replay API: subscriber requests replay from timestamp T; all subscribed events since T are re-delivered in original order.
- Per-subscriber observability: current lag, retry count, DLQ size.
- Chaos test: kill a subscriber mid-processing; restart; subscriber recovers via at-least-once delivery without duplicating acks.

---

## [P5-09] Localisation readiness: English labels fully extracted, RTL structural verified on staging

- **Phase:** 5  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P2-11  
- **Layers touched:** UI, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:5, type:afk, area:frontend, area:localisation`  

**Ships:** All UI labels extracted to i18n catalogue; RTL structural support validated on a staging build (no RTL locale shipped yet).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Every UI label is in the extraction catalogue (automated audit).
- Staging build with locale direction=rtl renders correctly on core + KitchenEquipment screens.
- No hard-coded English strings remain in frontend render paths.

---

## [P2-01] Identity hardening: SAML, MFA for admins, full RBAC hierarchy, ABAC

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** HITL — _RBAC role taxonomy and ABAC policy language decisions affect every downstream module; need architect sign-off._  
- **Blocked by:** P1-03  
- **PRD user stories:** #4  
- **Layers touched:** service, API, UI, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:hitl, area:platform, area:identity`  

**Ships:** Identity goes from 'one role, OIDC only' to production: SAML alongside OIDC, MFA enforced for admin roles, RBAC role hierarchy, ABAC policy engine with attribute-driven rules, delegated admin.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- SAML SP metadata published; SAML login works against a staging IdP.
- MFA required for any role in the 'admin' hierarchy; MFA enforcement testable.
- Role hierarchy: a role inherits permissions from parents; cycles rejected at definition time.
- ABAC policy engine evaluates policies like 'user can read items only in their plant'.
- Delegated admin: a tenant admin can create users and assign roles within their tenant, not across tenants.

---

## [P1-08] Core stub: CustomerRequirement entity with source_type + extensible_attributes

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-02, P1-04, P1-07  
- **PRD user stories:** #6, #9  
- **Layers touched:** schema, service, API, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:core, module:sales`  

**Ships:** The single core entity of the tracer bullet: CustomerRequirement with source_type enum, extensible_attributes JSONB, and create/list/read endpoints. Wired through tenancy, audit, and event-on-create.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Schema: CustomerRequirement(id, tenant_id, source_type enum [catalog_order, configurator_order, bom_import, boq_import, rfq_spec, contract_release, forecast_plan], source_payload jsonb, extensible_attributes jsonb, lifecycle status, audit fields).
- Create endpoint invokes the registered parser for the given source_type (from P1-06) and stores parsed lines.
- Every mutation emits an audit record (via P1-04) and publishes CustomerRequirementCreated (via P1-07).
- List and read endpoints are tenant-scoped via the P1-02 repository.
- Test: create with no parser registered for source_type returns the P1-06 'no parser' error cleanly.

---

## [P2-03] Audit production-grade: reader role, scheduled chain verification, retention policy, performance SLO

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-04  
- **PRD user stories:** #2, #17  
- **Layers touched:** service, API, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:audit`  

**Ships:** Audit moves from 'hash-chain works' to 'audit is a compliance substrate': dedicated reader role, scheduled verification, retention rules, performance SLOs.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Dedicated audit-reader role distinct from tenant admin; tenant admins cannot read audit logs by default.
- Hash-chain verification job runs hourly on staging, daily in prod; alerts on first break.
- Retention policy: 5 years online, 7 years archived; archival export works.
- Audit query latency SLO: p95 under 1s for entity-scoped queries on entities with 10,000+ records.
- Reason-for-change field is queryable; empty values allowed but indexed as NULL.

---

## [P2-10] Extension Framework: all 10 extension points, exercised by TestIndustry pack in CI

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-06, P2-07  
- **PRD user stories:** #1, #5  
- **Layers touched:** service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:extension-framework`  

**Ships:** All ten extension points from PRD live: entity attributes, workflow state/transitions, screen slots, master data seeds, workflow step types, validation rules, report templates, integration connectors, event subscriptions, permission scopes. TestIndustry pack exercises every one in CI.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Each extension point has a documented API with typed registration and discovery.
- TestIndustry pack registers via every extension point; its registration is verified in CI contract tests.
- A 'leaky pack' attempt — TestIndustry writes to a core table — is rejected at the repository layer with a clear error.
- Extension-point catalogue published as internal doc; each entry links to its TestIndustry example.

---

## [P2-06] Integration Fabric: connector framework + EDI engine stubs + webhook engine + scheduled sync + per-connector DLQ

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** HITL — _Concrete connector priority (Stripe, PayPal, FedEx, QuickBooks, Shopify) is PRD Open #3 and must be resolved before authoring real connectors._  
- **Blocked by:** P2-04  
- **Layers touched:** service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:hitl, area:platform, area:integration-fabric`  

**Ships:** The shape packs and future connectors plug into: a connector framework with codec hooks for X12 / EDIFACT / AS2 (stubs), webhook engine with signature verification, scheduled sync jobs, per-connector DLQ. No concrete third-party connector is authored yet.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Connector framework interface documented; packs + core modules register connectors declaratively.
- EDI codec stubs for X12, EDIFACT, AS2 parse trivial fixtures; full message coverage deferred until a real integration needs it.
- Webhook engine verifies signatures on inbound; signs outbound; rejects malformed requests at the edge.
- Scheduled sync runner: jobs declared per-connector; failures route to per-connector DLQ with alert.
- A dummy connector (for the TestIndustry pack) exercises every framework capability in CI.

---

## [P2-02] Tenancy lifecycle: provisioning, suspend, archive, pack activation with transactional rollback

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-02, P2-01  
- **PRD user stories:** #4, #13, #16  
- **Layers touched:** service, API, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:tenancy`  

**Ships:** Tenants have a real lifecycle (provision → active → suspended → archived) and pack activation is transactional: partial failure rolls back cleanly.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Tenant lifecycle state machine: provision → active → suspended → archived; suspended tenants reject all non-admin requests.
- Pack activation on a tenant is transactional: seed-data load + registry write commit together or neither commits.
- Deactivation flags pack-created data as orphaned but does not delete; a separate confirmed operation deletes.
- Pack activation and deactivation dry-run shows the list of extension points that will activate/deactivate before committing.
- Test: simulated failure during pack activation leaves tenant in previous state; no orphan seed data.

---

## [P1-09] KitchenEquipment pack stub: manifest + BOQ parser hook

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-06, P1-08  
- **PRD user stories:** #13, #14  
- **Layers touched:** pack, service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:pack, pack:kitchen-equipment`  

**Ships:** The KitchenEquipment pack as a manifest + one parser: accepts a fake BOQ payload, emits two parsed lines with fascia_type + cladding_type in extensible_attributes.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- KitchenEquipment pack manifest declares: id, version, depends_on (mode:eto), extends.integrations (boq_import parser), extends.entities (Item: fascia_type, cladding_type as typed attributes).
- BOQ parser is a hardcoded function that, given a fake payload, returns exactly two line items with valid fascia_type and cladding_type values.
- Parser registration via P1-06 is idempotent: pack reload does not double-register.
- Integration test: create a CustomerRequirement with source_type=boq_import and a fake payload; observe two lines stored with kitchen attributes; observe audit log attributes writes to 'pack:kitchen-equipment'.
- Pack-declared typed attributes are validated on save: save without fascia_type returns a pack-defined error (not a core error).

---

## [P1-10] TestIndustry dummy pack: subscribes to CustomerRequirementCreated

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-06, P1-07, P1-08  
- **PRD user stories:** #3  
- **Layers touched:** pack, service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:pack, pack:test-industry`  

**Ships:** A second pack whose only job is to prove the extension contract works for more than one consumer. Subscribes to CustomerRequirementCreated and logs receipt. Ships in the repo behind a non-activatable flag (per PRD Open #4 guidance).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- TestIndustry pack manifest declares: id, version, no real mode dependency, extends.integrations subscribes to CustomerRequirementCreated.
- Subscriber handler writes a structured log line: 'test-industry-pack received event for tenant X, cr_id Y'.
- Pack is flagged non-activatable-in-production via a feature flag; CI + staging can activate, production cannot.
- Test: with both KitchenEquipment and TestIndustry activated, a single CustomerRequirement creation triggers the KitchenEquipment parser AND delivers the event to TestIndustry subscriber; failure of one does not prevent the other.

---

## [P1-11] API Gateway v1: POST /api/v1/customer-requirements with OIDC auth

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P1-03, P1-08  
- **PRD user stories:** #4, #14  
- **Layers touched:** API, service, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:afk, area:platform, area:api-gateway`  

**Ships:** The single API endpoint of the tracer bullet: versioned, OIDC-authenticated, standard error envelope, Idempotency-Key scaffolding. Rate-limiting and GraphQL arrive in Phase 2.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- POST /api/v1/customer-requirements accepts JSON body { source_type, source_payload }; returns the created resource.
- OIDC session required; unauthenticated returns 401 in the standard error envelope { error_code, message, details, correlation_id }.
- Idempotency-Key header: same key + same body within the idempotency window returns the original response, not a duplicate.
- Versioning: path includes /v1/; breaking changes will bump to /v2/.
- Test: happy path, unauthenticated 401, cross-tenant 404, idempotent replay returns original id.

---

## [P5-06] Disaster-recovery drill: PITR + tenancy restart + DLQ replay

- **Phase:** 5  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P2-04, P2-03  
- **Layers touched:** tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:5, type:afk, area:test, area:resilience`  

**Ships:** DR drill covering point-in-time restore, platform restart with tenant provisioning preserved, DLQ replay reconstructing subscriber state.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- PITR drill on staging: restore to T-1h; audit hash chain verifies cleanly against the restored state.
- Platform restart test: tenant configuration and pack activations persist; user sessions re-establish.
- DLQ replay test: seed DLQ with 10k events; subscriber-initiated replay consumes them in order without duplicates (beyond at-least-once).

---

## [P3-01] BRS split exercise: map existing 14 BRSes into core vs KitchenEquipment pack

- **Phase:** 3  
- **Type:** HITL — _The BRS split is the foundational act of the whole re-architecture; needs architect + product review before any code._  
- **Blocked by:** P2-10  
- **Layers touched:** docs  
- **Labels:** `phase:3, type:hitl, area:docs, phase-gate`  

**Ships:** A checklist-driven split of every existing BRS module into (a) thin core spec and (b) KitchenEquipment pack spec. No code; this unblocks all P3 core-module work.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Every one of the 14 existing BRSes has two successor specs: thin core spec + KitchenEquipment pack delta.
- Every kitchen-specific concept (fascia, cladding, BOQ, NSF, finishing, commissioning templates, etc.) is claimed by the pack spec.
- Disposition rule is applied consistently: mode-agnostic + industry-agnostic = core; anything else = pack.
- Output lives in /docs/specs/core and /docs/specs/packs/kitchen-equipment.

---

## [P5-14] Documentation set: architecture layer model, extension-point catalogue, pack authoring guide, compatibility matrix

- **Phase:** 5  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P5-04, P2-10  
- **Layers touched:** docs  
- **Labels:** `phase:5, type:afk, area:docs`  

**Ships:** Publishable documentation set for internal use (and for eventual customer/partner consumption when OptiForge is commercially positioned).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Architecture layer model doc published with the 5-layer diagram and dependency rule.
- Extension-point catalogue doc lists all 10 points with example pack uses.
- Pack authoring guide walks through manifest, hooks, testing.
- Compatibility matrix kept current on release.
- All docs live in the KreupAI internal doc site and are linked from the project README.

---

## [P2-08] Document Store: versioned binary storage, check-in/out, retention, OCR indexing

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P2-02  
- **Layers touched:** service, API, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:document-store`  

**Ships:** The binary-asset substrate for drawings, PDFs, SOPs, contracts: versioned, with check-in/out, retention rules, OCR indexing feeding Elasticsearch.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Upload returns a document handle; subsequent versions create new revisions without overwriting.
- Check-in / check-out lock prevents concurrent edits; stale locks time out.
- Retention policy configurable per document class; expired documents are archived, not deleted, without explicit confirmation.
- OCR pipeline processes PDFs and images; extracted text is searchable via the Reporting Fabric query layer.
- Tenant-scoped: documents are isolated per tenant at both metadata and binary-storage layers.

---

## [P2-09] Notification service: email, SMS, push, in-app channels with templates, routing rules, opt-outs

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P2-02  
- **Layers touched:** service, API, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:notification`  

**Ships:** Unified notification service that every module and pack sends through; no module mails directly.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Channel adapters: email (SES / SendGrid), SMS (configurable provider), push, in-app inbox.
- Template library: i18n-ready templates versioned per tenant; fallback to core template if tenant has none.
- Routing rules: notify based on event + user preferences; opt-out respected globally except for transactional mandatories.
- Delivery status observable: sent / queued / failed / bounced.

---

## [P2-12] Reporting Fabric: unified query layer, scheduled reports, PDF/Excel/CSV export pipeline

- **Phase:** 2  
- **Type:** AFK  
- **Blocked by:** P2-02  
- **Layers touched:** service, API, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:2, type:afk, area:platform, area:reporting`  

**Ships:** Reporting substrate that every module reports through; no module generates its own exports.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Unified query layer: modules and packs register reportable views; reporting reads only from the view layer.
- Scheduled reports with cron-like specs; delivery via Notification service.
- Export pipeline: same report definition produces PDF, Excel, CSV consistently.
- Tenant-scoped throughout; cross-tenant isolation test covers reporting.

---

## [P1-12] UI: BOQ-upload page with pack-contributed KitchenSpecTab

- **Phase:** 1  
- **Type:** HITL — _Pack-slot rendering is a visual contract — a developer cannot self-verify that the slot renders correctly without a human eyeball on it._  
- **Blocked by:** P1-09, P1-11  
- **PRD user stories:** #13, #14  
- **Layers touched:** UI, tests  
- **Labels:** `phase:1, type:hitl, area:frontend, pack:kitchen-equipment`  

**Ships:** One Next.js page behind OIDC auth that lets a user upload a fake BOQ file and see the parsed result, with the KitchenEquipment pack's tab rendered into a pack-slot.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Page requires OIDC login; shows the authenticated user + their tenant.
