## KEY FINDINGS

### Pages That EXIST and Work Well
- Campaign Email, Automation, Performance, Templates pages
- Quote Create, Pricing, Templates pages
- Interactions Add, Edit, Timeline, Analysis pages
- Activities overview and Calendar pages
- Analytics overview and Sales analytics pages

### Pages That DON'T EXIST But Are Critical
- ALL View pages for main entities (Leads, Customers, Contacts, Opportunities, Quotes, Contracts, Campaigns)
- ALL Edit pages for main entities
- ALL Add/Create pages for main entities (except Quotes which exists)
- Order History page for customers
- Conversion workflows (Lead → Opportunity, Opportunity → Customer, Quote → Order)

### Buttons That Need Rich Content Pages
- "View Orders" button needs `/crm/customers/{id}/orders`
- "Schedule Visit" button needs `/crm/customers/{id}/schedule-visit`
- "Schedule Meeting" button needs `/crm/contacts/{id}/schedule-meeting`
- "Convert to Opportunity" needs conversion workflow page
- "Convert to Customer" needs conversion workflow page
- "Convert to Order" needs order creation from quote

### Current vs Needed State
- **Current**: List pages with filtering and bulk operations work well
- **Needed**: Individual record pages (View/Edit) for all major entities
- **Needed**: Create/Add forms for all major entities
- **Needed**: Workflow pages for conversions and special actions
