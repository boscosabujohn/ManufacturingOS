## Testing Recommendations

### Phase 1: Smoke Testing
1. Open the application
2. Verify sidebar renders without errors
3. Check all top-level modules are visible

### Phase 2: Navigation Testing
Test each module's sub-pages:
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] CRM (4 pages)
- [ ] Sales (2 pages)
- [ ] RFQ (1 page)
- [ ] Estimation (3 pages)
- [ ] Production (7 pages)
- [ ] Inventory (4 pages)
- [ ] Procurement (6 pages)
- [ ] Projects (4 pages)
- [ ] Finance (6 pages)
- [ ] HR (2 pages)
- [ ] Logistics (10 pages)
- [ ] After Sales Service (16 pages)
- [ ] Support (3 pages)
- [ ] Common Masters (55+ pages)
- [ ] IT Admin (4 pages)

### Phase 3: Verification
For each page, verify:
- ✅ Page loads without 404 error
- ✅ Correct content displays
- ✅ Breadcrumbs are correct
- ✅ Back navigation works

## Known Issues (Pre-existing)

These TypeScript errors exist in other files (NOT in Sidebar.tsx):
1. `finance/cash/bank-reconciliation/page.tsx` - Syntax errors
2. `inventory/warehouse/view/[id]/page.tsx` - Syntax errors
3. `procurement/vendors/page.tsx` - Missing closing parenthesis
4. `workflow/automation/page.tsx` - Missing closing JSX tags
5. `ProcurementRiskManagement.tsx` - JSX syntax issues
6. `SupplierOnboarding.tsx` - JSX syntax issues

## Migration Notes

### If You Had Custom Sidebar Configurations:
The following conceptual pages were removed (they never existed):
- Sales: RFP/Proposals, Order Handover
- Procurement: All 19 advanced features (Strategic Sourcing, Supplier Relationship, etc.)
- Finance: All 22 advanced features (Cash Flow, Asset Management, etc.)
- Project Management: Entire module (replaced with simplified "Projects")

### If You Were Accessing These URLs Directly:
Update your bookmarks/links to use the actual existing pages listed in this document.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the sidebar** in your development environment
2. **Fix pre-existing TypeScript errors** in other files (optional but recommended)
3. **Add missing pages** if any of the removed conceptual features are actually needed
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the actual application structure
5. **Train users** on the new sidebar organization

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that the page actually exists in `src/app/(modules)/[module-name]/`
2. Verify the route path matches the folder structure
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Review this document for the complete list of available pages
