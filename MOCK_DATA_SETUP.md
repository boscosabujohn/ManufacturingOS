## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

The RFP module now uses **frontend mock data** - no backend connection required!

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **Mock Data**: `b3-erp/frontend/src/data/mock-rfps.ts`
   - Contains 8 sample RFPs with complete data
   - Ready to use for development and testing

2. **Service Updated**: `b3-erp/frontend/src/services/rfp.service.ts`
   - Added `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` flag
   - Returns mock data instead of API calls
   - Includes simulated delay for realistic UX
   - Supports filtering by status, priority, type, and search

3. **Page Enhanced**: `b3-erp/frontend/src/app/(modules)/sales/rfp/page.tsx`
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Better error handling

   ```typescript
   const USE_MOCK_DATA = false; // Change to false
   ```
3. Make sure backend is running on port 8000
4. Refresh the page

## üìù Mock Data Structure

Each RFP includes:
- Basic info (number, title, description)
- Customer details (name, contact person, email, phone)
- Dates (issue date, submission deadline, project dates)
- Financial (estimated budget, proposal value, payment terms)
- Items (detailed list with quantities and costs)
- Requirements (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
- Timeline milestones
- Team assignments
- Tags and metadata

## üöÄ Next Steps

Now that you have mock data working, you can:

1. **Build RFP Response Module**
   - Create response page
   - Add technical response section
   - Add commercial response section
   - Add compliance section

2. **Test the UI**
   - Verify all fields display correctly
   - Test search and filters
   - Test view/edit modals

3. **Add More Features**
   - Export to PDF
   - Email notifications
   - Team collaboration
   - Document attachments

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Page shows "No RFPs Found"
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Look for `[RFP Service]` logs showing mock data loading
3. Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check that `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` in rfp.service.ts

### Data not updating after changes
1. Make sure you saved the files
2. Refresh the browser
3. Check Next.js terminal for compilation errors

### Want to add more RFPs
1. Edit `b3-erp/frontend/src/data/mock-rfps.ts`
2. Add new RFP objects to the `MOCK_RFPS` array
3. Follow the same structure as existing RFPs
4. Save and refresh
