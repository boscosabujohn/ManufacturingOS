# B3 ERP Improvement Roadmap

## Process Flow Overview

**Root shell and redirect** ‚Äì The app wraps every page with a minimal HTML shell that loads the Inter font and global styles, then immediately redirects the home route to the main dashboard, making the dashboard the starting point for any user journey.

**Dashboard-first navigation** ‚Äì The dashboard composes the experience: it instantiates the sidebar, header, mega-menu, search, and module cards from a single React component that currently relies on local state, so any process flow begins here before drilling into a module view.

**Global navigation scaffolding** ‚Äì The collapsible sidebar and top mega-menu define the cross-module flow, but many entries either point to placeholder routes or are not yet backed by pages, causing navigation dead ends during exploration.
