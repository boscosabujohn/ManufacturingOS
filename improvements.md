Process Flow Overview
Root shell and redirect – The app wraps every page with a minimal HTML shell that loads the Inter font and global styles, then immediately redirects the home route to the main dashboard, making the dashboard the starting point for any user journey.

Dashboard-first navigation – The dashboard composes the experience: it instantiates the sidebar, header, mega-menu, search, and module cards from a single React component that currently relies on local state, so any process flow begins here before drilling into a module view.

Global navigation scaffolding – The collapsible sidebar and top mega-menu define the cross-module flow, but many entries either point to placeholder routes or are not yet backed by pages, causing navigation dead ends during exploration.

Module-by-Module Observations & Improvement Opportunities
Dashboard & Navigation
Replace hard-coded module definitions with data-driven configuration (and add category metadata) so the category filter tabs actually filter the grid; at present only free-text search works because the module list lacks category fields.

Extract reusable card, stat, and toolbar components to cut duplication across modules and simplify future theming.

Audit sidebar and mega-menu links—many reference '#' or non-existent paths, which breaks the intended flow between modules; add route guards or status badges to communicate what is implemented.

Common Masters
Swap the static masterCategories array for a fetched list so counts and descriptions reflect real master data; the current implementation renders fixed copy only.

Add deep links or CTA buttons per tile to move users into the relevant maintenance screens, rather than presenting informational cards with no actions.

CRM
Connect the stats, recent leads, and opportunities to live data instead of the in-component useState mocks, enabling refresh controls, loading states, and error handling.

Layer in filters (status, owner, probability) and table utilities (sorting, pagination) so users can manage large lists beyond the four hard-coded records.

Sales
Wire the dashboard to real revenue and order sources—the KPIs, recent orders, and top customers are presently fixed arrays, preventing trend analysis or updates.

Convert the static lists into interactive tables with filtering by status/priority and add empty/loading states for better UX continuity.

CPQ
Populate metrics, recent quotes, and quick actions via service calls; right now everything is a static constant, so the dashboard cannot react to workflow changes.

Add quote filters (status, owner, created date) and integrate the “New Quote” CTA with a real route to complete the CPQ process.

Estimation
Replace the hard-coded stats/activities arrays with fetched estimation data, and introduce sorting or grouping by project, priority, or estimator for manageability.

Provide workflow cues (e.g., approval status filters, actionable buttons) so users can progress estimates instead of just viewing static cards.

Inventory
Hook up the dashboard to inventory services to reflect real-time stock, movements, and low-stock alerts; every widget currently renders fixed sample data.

Introduce pagination/virtualization for movement logs and allow export/filters to cope with high transaction volumes.

Production
Replace the mocked work orders and line status arrays with live data feeds so KPIs, progress bars, and statuses stay current.

Create drill-down links from cards to detailed production views (e.g., a work-order table) to make the module more than a static snapshot.

Procurement
Break the monolithic component into smaller chart/table components and source data via async hooks; the current component initializes extensive mock datasets inside the render file, inflating bundle size and blocking reuse.

Add user controls for period/category selection that drive data queries instead of just setting local state without downstream effects.

Finance
Replace the local dashboard data object with API-driven state and align with the existing Axios client for consistency; this will also enable the refresh spinner and period selectors to have functional behavior.

Factor heavy JSX blocks (cards, charts) into reusable components to improve readability and maintainability.

HR
Swap the inline stats, recentActivities, and departmentStats with service-backed data so the dashboard reflects actual HR events.

Implement filters or tabs for activities (leave/payroll/etc.) and provide actions (approve/reject) instead of the passive list.

Logistics
Connect shipment and KPI widgets to logistics data sources; the useState mocks keep the dashboard static and prevent users from seeing real shipment progress.

Embed map integration or route visualization hooks to augment the textual status cards, enabling actionable tracking.

After-Sales Service
Replace the mock stats and ticket arrays with real service data and provide actions for dispatching technicians or escalating tickets.

Ensure the specialized dashboards (e.g., /after-sales-service/dashboard) load shared service utilities so metrics and trends stay synchronized across subpages.

Support
Source metrics, ticket lists, and SLA stats from the support system instead of the eight-item mock arrays, and wire CTA buttons (“Create Ticket”, “View All”) to living routes.

Add filters (priority, assignee) and dynamic refresh to keep incident handling responsive.

IT Administration
Feed the dashboard with live telemetry (users, servers, resource usage) by integrating with admin services; the systemStats object is currently hard-coded.

Surface deeper drill-downs (e.g., to user or server management) via actionable buttons to support administration workflows.

RFQ Management
Use the existing RFP service patterns to replace the static mockRFQs; doing so will allow search and status filters to operate on true procurement data.

Expand list functionality with pagination, bulk actions, and exporting options to support large RFQ volumes.

Projects (Standalone Dashboard)
Populate the overview with actual project metrics and connect the search bar to the project list; the component currently renders static cards and an empty placeholder.

Introduce per-project navigation (cards or table rows) to bridge to detailed planning/execution pages.

Project Management
Replace the large mockProjects array with data from a project store/service and implement virtualization for scalable listings.

Convert status/progress values into interactive filters, and break the component into list, toolbar, and stats subcomponents for clarity.

Reports & Analytics
Drive analytics metrics and chart datasets from real reporting endpoints; the page defines multiple static arrays for KPIs, time series, category splits, etc., so charts never update.

Add asynchronous loading/error states and caching for heavy charts to avoid blocking renders when hooking into live data.

Workflow Automation
Integrate the automation list with a workflow service (create/activate/pause) rather than relying on the mockAutomations constant defined in the component.

Provide pagination, search, and bulk actions for rules to help administrators manage large rule sets.

Cross-Cutting Enhancements
Align modules with the shared Axios client and service layer so dashboards can load real data consistently (e.g., reuse api-client and the interactions/RFP services already scaffolded).

Establish shared UI primitives for KPI cards, tables, filters, and charts to reduce duplication across modules and simplify future UX refinements.

These changes will turn the current static showcase into an interactive, data-driven front-end while preserving the module-by-module structure the project is already organized around.After-Sales Service (src/app/(modules)/after-sales-service/page.tsx)

Overall Gap Themes

Every module renders fixed useState datasets, demonstrating a static showcase without live integrations, workflow engines, or role-aware security controls.

Industry-standard solutions provide data governance, automation, predictive analytics, extensibility, and deep cross-module integrations that are presently absent across the board.
