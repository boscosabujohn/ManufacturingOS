# RFP Response Management System

## Overview
This system is designed to comprehensively manage **responses to RFPs** (Request for Proposals), not create RFPs. As a manufacturing company, you receive RFPs from clients and need to prepare detailed, professional responses that cover all aspects required to win the business.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Backend API running on port 8000 with RFP endpoints
2. Frontend running on port 3000 with RFP list page

4. Comprehensive RFP Response TypeScript types defined

### üî® Next Steps
1. Implement RFP Response detail page
