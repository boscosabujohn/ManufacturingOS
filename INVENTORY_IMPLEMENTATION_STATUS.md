## Recommended Implementation Approach

Given the extensive size of the Inventory module (71 pages), I recommend a **phased, focused approach**:

### Phase 1: Core Stock Operations (PRIORITY: CRITICAL)
**Target: Main Inventory Dashboard & Stock Management**

**Modal Files to Create:**
1. **InventoryStockModals.tsx** (~1,500 lines)
   - ViewStockDetailsModal
   - AddStockItemModal
   - EditStockItemModal
   - QuickAdjustmentModal
   - LowStockAlertModal

2. **InventoryExportModals.tsx** (~800 lines)
   - ExportStockDataModal
   - ExportMovementReportModal
   - ExportValuationModal

**Pages to Integrate:**
- `inventory/page.tsx` (Main Dashboard)
- `inventory/stock/page.tsx`
- `inventory/stock/low-stock/page.tsx`

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** High - covers 80% of daily user interactions

### Phase 2: Movements & Transfers (PRIORITY: HIGH)
**Target: Day-to-day Operations**

**Modal Files:**
3. **InventoryMovementModals.tsx** (~1,400 lines)
   - ReceiveStockModal
   - IssueStockModal
   - ViewMovementDetailsModal

4. **InventoryTransferModals.tsx** (~1,600 lines)
   - CreateTransferModal (wizard)
   - ApproveTransferModal
   - ReceiveTransferModal

**Pages to Integrate:**
- `inventory/movements/page.tsx`
- `inventory/transfers/page.tsx`

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days
**Impact:** High - critical operational workflows

### Phase 3: Accuracy & Control (PRIORITY: MEDIUM-HIGH)
**Target: Inventory Accuracy**

**Modal Files:**
5. **InventoryAdjustmentModals.tsx** (~1,200 lines)
6. **InventoryCycleCountModals.tsx** (~1,300 lines)

**Pages to Integrate:**
- `inventory/adjustments/page.tsx`
- `inventory/cycle-count/page.tsx`

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** Medium-High - accuracy and compliance

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)
**Target: Analytics & Optimization**

**Modal Files:**
7. **InventoryAnalyticsModals.tsx** (~1,100 lines)
8. **InventoryWarehouseModals.tsx** (~900 lines)

**Pages to Integrate:**
- `inventory/analytics/reports/page.tsx`
- `inventory/warehouse/page.tsx`

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** Medium - insights and planning

### Phase 5: Specialized Tracking (PRIORITY: LOW-MEDIUM)
**Target: Serial/Batch/Barcode**

**Modal Files:**
9. **InventoryTrackingModals.tsx** (~1,000 lines)

**Pages to Integrate:**
- `inventory/tracking/serial/page.tsx`
- `inventory/tracking/batch/page.tsx`
- `inventory/tracking/barcode/page.tsx`

**Estimated Time:** 2 days
**Impact:** Medium - specialized workflows

## Total Estimated Timeline
- **Full Implementation:** 4-5 weeks (20-25 days)
- **Phase 1 Only:** 2-3 days (recommended to start)
- **Phases 1-2:** 1 week (covers core operations)
- **Phases 1-3:** 2 weeks (includes accuracy controls)

## Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1 immediately** to deliver high-value functionality quickly:

1. Create the 2 critical modal files (Stock + Export)
2. Integrate into main dashboard and stock pages
3. Test and gather user feedback
4. Use feedback to refine approach for subsequent phases

This approach:
- ✅ Delivers immediate value (dashboard enhancement)
- ✅ Validates modal patterns for inventory domain
- ✅ Allows iterative refinement
- ✅ Avoids overwhelming scope
- ✅ Enables parallel work on other modules

## Next Steps

**Option A: Focused Implementation (Recommended)**
- Implement Phase 1 only (Stock + Export modals)
- Integrate into main pages
- Test and validate
- Proceed to Phase 2 based on results

**Option B: Comprehensive Implementation**
- Create all 9 modal files
- Integrate across all 71 pages
- Requires 4-5 weeks

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Create Phases 1-2 (Stock, Export, Movement, Transfer)
- Cover 90% of daily operations
- Leave specialized features for later

## Awaiting Decision
Please confirm which approach to proceed with:
- [ ] Phase 1 Only (2-3 days) - Recommended
- [ ] Phases 1-2 (1 week) - Good balance
- [ ] Full Implementation (4-5 weeks) - Comprehensive
