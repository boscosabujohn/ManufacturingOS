# OptiForge / ManufacturingOS

**A layered multi-industry manufacturing ERP.** OptiForge is structured as five layers — Platform → Core → Modes → Compliance → Industry Packs — with a strict core/pack seam: every layer depends only on layers below it, and industry-specific logic lives exclusively in packs. B3 MACBIS kitchen equipment is the first customer and the KitchenEquipment pack is the only industry pack shipping in v1.

This repo holds the monorepo: Django + DRF + PostgreSQL 15 backend, Next.js 14 + TypeScript + shadcn frontend, Celery + RabbitMQ + Redis for background work.

## For a new developer: read these, in order

1. [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md) — index of all project documentation.
2. [`docs/brainstorms/2026-04-23-optiforge-layered-multi-industry.md`](./docs/brainstorms/2026-04-23-optiforge-layered-multi-industry.md) — why the architecture is layered, what was rejected, open questions resolved.
3. [`docs/prds/optiforge-layered-multi-industry-architecture.md`](./docs/prds/optiforge-layered-multi-industry-architecture.md) — the Product Requirements Document. The source of truth every issue references.
4. [`docs/plans/optiforge-layered-multi-industry-architecture.md`](./docs/plans/optiforge-layered-multi-industry-architecture.md) — the phased build plan. Phase 1 is the tracer bullet; start there.
5. [`docs/adr/README.md`](./docs/adr/README.md) — decisions log. Read before making an architectural choice; add an ADR before committing one.
6. [`docs/runbooks/phase-1-kickoff-checklist.md`](./docs/runbooks/phase-1-kickoff-checklist.md) — what must be decided and done before anyone picks up issue P1-01.

The GitHub issues (labelled `phase:1`..`phase:5`) are the unit of work. Issues reference the PRD and plan; the PRD and plan reference the brainstorm. Nothing references code paths or file locations because those go stale.

## The load-bearing rule

> A pack can **read** core entities, **extend** them via declared extension points, and **observe** core events — but it cannot **write** to core tables, **override** core logic, or **fork** core code. If a pack needs something core doesn't expose, the answer is to add an extension point to core, not to patch core.

Violations of this rule are caught automatically by the cross-layer import linter in CI (shipped by issue P1-01). If the linter fails on your PR, you have a layer violation — not a linter bug.

## Getting started (once Phase 1 scaffolding is in place)

_Phase 1 issue P1-01 delivers the initial scaffolding. Once that lands, replace this section with real setup instructions. For now:_

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/boscosabujohn/ManufacturingOS.git
cd ManufacturingOS

# Backend (after P1-01)
# cd backend && python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend (after P1-01)
# cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Where to ask questions

- **Architectural question:** open a GitHub Discussion under the "Architecture" category, or an ADR draft in `docs/adr/`.
- **Bug in an existing module:** file a GitHub issue with the relevant `module:*` or `pack:*` label.
- **Scope dispute on an existing issue:** comment on the issue. If the dispute is about cutting scope from Phase 1, the default answer is "no, add it to Phase 2+."

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1 (Tracer Bullet)** | Not started |
